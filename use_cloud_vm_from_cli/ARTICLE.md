# Use Cloud VM directly from your command line

![Cloud img](https://www.padok.fr/hubfs/Images/Blog/vm_metadata.webp)

So you're a developer and using cloud instances for your projects and development purposes. It turns out you have to use your mouse or touchpad to hover and click lots of buttons to start/stop instances configure and use these cloud services on the web interface. Modern problems require modern solutions.
 
Please, meet [CLVM(Cloud VM)](https://github.com/BstLabs/py-clvm). It will make your life easier.
 
CLVM is an open-source command-line tool that provides convenient access to users' cloud instances over an SSM connection.
It's built on top of [DynaCLI](https://github.com/BstLabs/py-dynacli), another awesome open-source tool by [BST Labs](https://github.com/BstLabs/).
 
## Motivation
The rationale behind this tool is to end the struggle of using the web interface to create, access, and configure several services to handle cloud instances.
 
In this article, I will try my best to show how CLVM can help to decrease the inconveniences associated with a cloud environment. Mostly I'll be writing about using AWS Instances, SSM Sessions and VSCode Remote through CLVM.
 
 
## Installation
Install it via `pip`
```
$ pip3 install pyclvm
```
 
Thanks to DynaCLI, when installation is finished you will have the `clvm` command added to your terminal palette.
 
With a quick maneuver, just type `clvm -h` and you can read automatically derived docstrings and usage.
 
```
$ clvm -h
usage: clvm [-h] [-v] {connect,instance,redirect,ssh,ssm,vscode} ...

positional arguments:
 {connect,instance,redirect,ssh,ssm,vscode}
   connect             connect to a Virtual Machine
   instance            vm instance management
   redirect            start/stop port redirection session
   ssh                 start/stop ssh session
   ssm                 session manager utilities
   vscode              microsoft vscode utilities
 
optional arguments:
 -h, --help            show this help message and exit
 -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

## Working with instances

The fastest route is to type `clvm connect <instance_name>`. It automatically starts the VM instance and connects to it.

To only start an instance we need to type:
```bash
$ clvm instance start <instance_name>
Starting <instance_name> ...
<instance_name> is running
```
Next, we connect to our running instance via `clvm connect <instance_name>` and et voil√†! We can operate within our instance from the local terminal. Of course, you are not limited to using the only terminal. VSCode Remote and Port redirection are some of the choices. Please, suit yourself.

## Default and optional configuration arguments
Currently, CLVM supports AWS. The following versions of the tool will work with multiple cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, etc. So optional arguments will be important to maintain these resources. Please consider that we have only 2 optional arguments with default values for now, `profile` and `port` arguments. Default values are applied unless the optional arguments are explicitly specified.

They are as follows:

`profile` = default

`port` = 8080

You can set it to your preferred profile or port via passing it explicitly.

Example:

```bash
$ clvm connect <instance_name> profile=<profile_name>
$ clvm redirect <instance_name> profile=<profile_name> port=<port_number>
```


## Port redirection
In my example, I have VSCode installed on my cloud instance. So, if I use `clvm redirect start <instance_name>` I'll have my vscode server set on `http://localhost:8080/` ready.
Easy, isn't it?! That reduces the complex port redirecting process via bash scripting to the usage of only 4 consecutive statements. You don't even have to start instances separately, because the `redirect` command does that for us. Stopping redirection is a piece of cake too. Just type `stop` instead of `start` and it will exit from redirection and stop the instance as well.

## SSH key generation
The need for a new ssh key generation for a particular machine is met by typing `clvm ssh new <instance_name>`. This statement generates and saves the SSH key to the corresponding directory with the help of AuthK under the hood. [AuthK](https://github.com/BstLabs/py-authk) is another open-source library from BST Labs. Visit the link for more detailed information and source code.

#### SSH tunneling
`clvm ssh start` command can be used for SSH tunneling. You need to specify <instance_name> as always and <port_number>.

## Session management
With the help of CLVM, we have good control over sessions.
```
$ clvm ssm session -h
usage: clvm ssm session [-h] {start,stop,ls} ...
 
positional arguments:
 {start,stop,ls}
   start          start ssm session
   stop           terminate ssm session
   ls             display active sessions

optional arguments:
 -h, --help       show this help message and exit
 
```
With CLVM it's possible to send shell commands to cloud instances directly from your local terminal. For that purpose, it has a `clvm ssm shell` statement. It takes an instance name as the first argument and commands in string format. To pass several commands you need to separate them with commas. For example:
```
$ clvm ssm shell <instance_name> "echo From cloud instance", "echo Hello, World!"
<instance_name> is running
From cloud instance,
Hello, World!

```

One of the good things about CLVM is that the syntax is very intuitive and easy. The help messages and commands are pretty self-explanatory.

## Working with VSCode Remote over SSH
To do that we have `clvm vscode` command.
```
$ clvm vscode -h
usage: clvm vscode [-h] {install,start} ...

positional arguments:
  {install,start}
    install        install vscode local
    start          obtain token, start instance if required, and launch vscode editor

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
``` 
As it seems from the documentation, in case you don't have VSCode installed on your local machine, you can use `install` to do all the installation steps automatically. You will get some useful vscode extensions installed like Python, remote-ssh, LTeX, etc.

## Summary
The article is aimed to contain information about the open-source solution for cloud developers and enthusiasts. It explains how CLVM helps to "do the thing" and not experience stress on gibberish code. The tool hides all the underlying nerdy processes and provides users with a clean and secure cloud development experience.

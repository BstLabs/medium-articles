# How to Write User-friendly Command Line Interfaces using Python functions

This story is based on the article [How to Write User-friendly Command Line Interfaces in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-user-friendly-command-line-interfaces-in-python-cc3a6444af8e)

In original article following Python libraries were shown for building a *vaccination QR code* for you : argparse, Click, Typer, Docopt, Fire.

We want to extend this article by using [dynacli](https://pypi.org/project/dynacli/).
There is fair enough comparison between libraries [DynaCLI vs. Alternatives](https://bstlabs.github.io/py-dynacli/advanced/why/).

## What are we building?

The core concept behind our changes is to ease down the process of building CLI applications by focusing only on Python code itself.
To keep it simple dynacli generates help messages from the Python function docstrings and the function arguments are converted to CLI commands.

Sounds interesting? Let's start.

The starter code grabbed from the original [article]((https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-user-friendly-command-line-interfaces-in-python-cc3a6444af8e)):

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field, asdict
import requests
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

class ValidationException(Exception):
    pass

@dataclass
class Vaccination:
    manufacturer: str
    date: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        try:
            date = datetime.strptime(self.date, "%Y-%m-%d")
        except Exception:
            raise ValidationException("Vaccination date should be in format YYYY-MM-DD.")
        if date > datetime.today():
            raise ValidationException("Vaccination date should not be a future date.")
        if self.manufacturer.lower() not in ["pfizer","moderna","astrazeneca","janssen","sinovac"]:
            raise ValidationException("Your vaccine manufacturer is not approved.")

@dataclass
class QRCode:
    name: str
    birth: str
    vaccine: list[Vaccination] = field(default_factory=list)

def generate_qr_code(qr_code):
    code = asdict(qr_code)
    res = requests.get(f"http://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data={code}", stream=True)
    if res.status_code == 200:
        with open("qr_code.png", "wb") as f:
            res.raw.decode_content = True
            shutil.copyfileobj(res.raw, f)
        return "QR code has been generated."
    else:
        raise Exception("QR code cannot be generated by QR Code Generator API.")
```

Then you need to generate build CLI for eg, using argparse, again shown in original article:

```py
def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Generate your vaccination QR code.")
    parser.add_argument("-n", "--name", type=str, help="Your name", required=True)
    parser.add_argument("-b", "--birth", type=str, help="Your birthday in YYYY-MM-DD format", required=True)
    parser.add_argument("-m", "--manufacturer", type=str, nargs="+", help="The vaccine manufacturer", required=True, choices=[
            "pfizer","moderna","astrazeneca","janssen","sinovac"])
    parser.add_argument("-d", "--date", type=str, nargs="+", help="The date of vaccination", required=True)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if len(args.manufacturer) != len(args.date):
        logging.error(
            "The number of vaccine manufacturer doesn't match with the number of vaccine dates."
        )
        exit(1)
    
    qr_code = QRCode(name=args.name, birth=args.birth, vaccine=[Vaccination(args.manufacturer[i], args.date[i]) for i in range(len(args.date))])
    generate_qr_code(qr_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except ValidationException as e:
        logging.error(e)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(e)
```

Building CLIs in general divided in 2 steps: first the core code and second the CLI itself predefined as set of arguments, as shown above.

With [dynacli](https://pypi.org/project/dynacli/) we can skip 2nd part by designing our functions to be CLI-friendly.

## Our changes to the original code

If you notice, the Vaccine manufacturers are limited set of companies and those kind of information is a best fit for Enum type:

```py
from enum import Enum

class Manufacturer(Enum):
    pfizer = 1
    moderna = 2
    astrazeneca = 3
    janssen = 4
    sinovac = 5

```

Therefore, we do not need manufacturer check in the `__post_init__` anymore and can remove it, our updated Vaccination class in `generate_qr_code.py` file looks like:

```py
@dataclass
class Vaccination:
    manufacturer: Manufacturer
    date: str

    def __post_init__(self):
        try:
            date = datetime.strptime(self.date, "%Y-%m-%d")
        except Exception:
            raise ValidationException(
                "Vaccination date should be in format YYYY-MM-DD."
            )
        if date > datetime.today():
            raise ValidationException("Vaccination date should not be a future date.")
```

The second big step is to design actual `generate_qr_code` function in a way that it is going to accept all necessary information as arguments:

```py
def generate_qr_code(
    name: str, birth: str, *manufacturer: Manufacturer, **date: str
) -> None:
    """
    Generate your vaccination QR code.

    Args:
        name (str): name of the vaccinated person
        birth (str): birthday of the vaccinated person in YYYY-MM-DD format
        *manufacturer (Enum): manufacturer of the vaccine
        **date (str): date of the vaccination

    Return: None
    """
    dates: list[str] = list(date.values())
    
    qr_code = QRCode(
        name=name,
        birth=birth,
        vaccine=[Vaccination(manufacturer[i], dates[i]) for i in range(len(manufacturer))],
    )
    code = asdict(qr_code)
    res = requests.get(
        f"http://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?data={code}", stream=True
    )
    if res.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception("QR code cannot be generated by QR Code Generator API.")
    with open("qr_code.png", "wb") as f:
        res.raw.decode_content = True
        shutil.copyfileobj(res.raw, f)
    print("QR code has been generated.")
```

The big change is we are going to accept variable length manufacturer names and dates will be passed as keyword arguments.
This is quite intuitive isn't it? Thinking about CLI call, it will look like: `./cli generate-qr-code Shako 1989-10-24 pfizer pfizer 1st_dosage=2021-01-01 2nd_dosage=2021-06-01`

The next importan change is - we have docstring with explanation of the arguments - you are right, dynacli uses this for building the help messages of the CLI.
Again quite Pythonic - we already added explanation, why register same help message for building CLI?

The rest of the code is mostly the same - functionally no change, the logic is the same.

## CLI entrypoint

Now just last step, create CLI entrypoint with dynacli, create a file called `cli` and add following:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
Sample QR Generator
"""

import os
import sys

cwd = os.path.dirname(__file__)

__version__ = '1.0'

from dynacli import main

search_path = [cwd]
sys.path.extend(search_path)

main(search_path)
```

As you have alreadu noticed, again there is no CLI pre-processing, adding arguments, version callback etc.
Everything is dead simple Python. DynaCLI grabs version from `__version__` and CLI name from cli docstring.

And that is it, now are ready to run the CLI, just give the execution priveleges to this file:

```sh
chmod u+x cli
```

Getting help output:

```sh
$ ./cli -h

usage: cli [-h] [-v] {generate-qr-code} ...

Sample QR Generator

positional arguments:
  {generate-qr-code}
    generate-qr-code  Generate your vaccination QR code.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -v, --version       show program's version number and exit
```

Getting the version:

```sh
$ ./cli --version

cli - v1.0
```

DynaCLI detects `generate_qr_code.py` file and it has `generate_qr_code` function in it.
If you recall this function has a docstring - yes, that is the help message registered from function docstring.

Getting help about actual command:

```py
$ ./cli generate-qr-code -h

usage: cli generate-qr-code [-h] name birth [manufacturer ...] [date <name>=<value> ...]

positional arguments:
  name                 name of the vaccinated person
  birth                birthday of the vaccinated person in YYYY-MM-DD format
  manufacturer         manufacturer of the vaccine ['pfizer', 'moderna', 'astrazeneca', 'janssen', 'sinovac']
  date <name>=<value>  date of the vaccination

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
```

Wait, we did not added or registered any help messages - no need they are grabbed from function docstring.

DynaCLI detects `**kwargs` and registers it as `<name>=<value>` pair.

It also detects Enum type and registers them as CLI choices.

Now it is time to run our actual final command(function):

```sh
$ ./cli generate-qr-code Shako 1989-10-24 pfizer pfizer 1st_dosage=2021-01-01 2nd_dosage=2021-06-01

QR code has been generated.
```

That's it. We have focused only to the core functionality, cleaned it up a bit, reshaped it to be CLI friendly - and that is how the CLIs should be.
You only enjoy your Python code, nothing more.
